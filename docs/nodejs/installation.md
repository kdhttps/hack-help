# Installation

To run node application, you need to first install **node** in your system.

For installing node and npm please refer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

> Note: I recommended to use npm@5, Because it provides `npm audit` facility to check vulnerability in your dependencies.

Check version in you system
```
$ node -v

v10.7.0
```

```
npm -v

6.2.0
```

> Note: If you have lower version of npm, update it using command `npm install -g npm@latest`.
