# Installation

:wine_glass: To run node application, you need to first install **node** in your system.

:wine_glass: For installing node and npm please refer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

!!! info
    I recommended to use npm@5, Because it provides `npm audit` facility to check vulnerability in your dependencies.

:wine_glass: Check version in you system
```
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```

!!! tip
    If you have lower version of npm, update it using command `npm install -g npm@latest`.
